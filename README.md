# ExcellentSnek
Sorts excel data from an import file, manipulates the data in memory and spits out a new file with your sorted data using Python3, and OpenPyxl

You will need OpenPyxl for this python script to work

This is bare bones code left here for anyone looking to do some quick and dirty data manipulation.

The python script is written for linux, you may remove the #! /usr/bin/python3 if using a windows machine

The included xlsx file is simply to help you test.
